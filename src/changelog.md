EasyWinHash was released under the D-FSL license and is open-source. The source code can be downloaded from GitHub or from the website.

If EasyWinHash is going to be pressed onto a commercial CD-ROM (with magazine), it would be nice to send me an issue of this CD-ROM (with magazine). You can contact me under team@pm-codeworks.de and I will give you my address.
